if you use HillTau

HillTau works with the FindSim project (https://findsim.ncbs.res.in/)
Specifically, HillTau can be used as an alternative simulator to MOOSE
and because of its efficiency, is a very good way to perform initial
model development and optimization when matching against experimental data.
